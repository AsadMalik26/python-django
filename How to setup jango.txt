i learned we need to install django for every project as we create-react-app then npm install to install packages.


1. make virtual environment
$ python -m venv venv

2. activate it
$ venv\Scripts\activate

3. install django
$ pip install django
OR
$ python -m pip install Django

- both above are same
- note: step 3 needs internet connecton

4. now you have django-admin utility installed
//now you can start your project in the named folder (i.e: folder: mysite)
$ django-admin startproject mysite

Done - ready for project


Run project for future:
- you do not have need to install django again
- but you have to setup activate virtual enviroment then you can access django-admin
